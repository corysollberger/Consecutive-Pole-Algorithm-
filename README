The algorithm basically runs through all possible combinations of triples that can be 
generated from a user's specified pole lengths.

The System uses 3 nested loops to test for each successful combination, which have
iteration variables a,b,c, respectively.

Triple represented by (a,b,c), where a, b, and c are integers within the list of pole
lengths specified by the user. 

All combinations of triples are checked, with each pole length specified.

To test,
1. Compile and Run
2. Enter Pole lengths
3. 0 to end
4. Displays the variable r, followed by r lines with a lexicographical order of 
successful combinations

Example:
	Input: 3 5 10 2 1
	Output: 2
			1,2,3
			1,3,5
			
Should work as specified, seems to work for any integer values I have entered
